    <h2> <font color="black">Christopher Crane</h2></Center>
    <p><Center>Hello there! My degree is Computer information and technology.
        <p>Currently I am the Regional Repair Manager for Central Utah Educational Services.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to the following:</p><p>
        <p>• Wood working
        • 3D Printing</p>
        <p>• Fixing computers/phones/tablets
        • Embarrassing my Wife</p>
        <p>• Leather working
        • Cooking/baking</p>
        <p>• Playing with my dogs
        • Playing video games
        •	And a whole bunch more!</p>

        <p>I am married, my Wife's name is Kali. We don't currently have any human babies. We do however have 3 dogs aka Fur Babies.</p>
         <p>This is my first semester here at BYU-I. My Wife is an Alumni. It is a great school and lots of opportunites available. I am pursuing a Bacherlors degree.</p>   
            </p> Well as we see in this world we are always using some sort of web interface. Unless of course we are out in the mountains and we don't have service. Even then if we are using an app of any kind we will be using a form of code/design principles.
            <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints for 17 years but wasn't very active until I was almost 16. I have lots of quotes I love from the leaders and I could probably make a whole webpage just about that.</p>
